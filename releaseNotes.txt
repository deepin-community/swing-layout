    inadvertently modified.

1.0.2 Release (2007/2/5)
--------------------------
25: Visibility handling
37: Changing visibility of components may result in 0 sized gap
38: Support baseline alignment of vertical groups
43: Incorrect parameter passed to super() call
45: Preferred gaps are not calculated correctly for invisible components

1.0.1 Release (2006/6/7)
--------------------------
The following bugs have been fixed:

30: Adding then removing a component can result in an exception
31: Add a setLayoutStyle method to GroupLayout
32: Baseline should use instanceof
33: BASELINE and CENTER constants have the same value
40: AccessControlException when using GroupLayout in an applet
42: ComponentOrientation not honored

WARNING: The fix for issue 33 (BASELINE and CENTER constants have the
same value) has introduced an incompatibility. Prior to fixing 33 both
constants BASELINE and CENTER had the same value. Because java copies
the values for integer constants into the byte codes it means if you
do not recompile with 1.0.1 you may encounter problems. The easy way
to fix the problem is recompile with 1.0.1 and all will be well.
